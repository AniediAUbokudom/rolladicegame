Roll the Dice Game
 
Roll the Dice Game is a simple game where players take turns rolling a virtual dice to get a random number between 1 and 6. 

The game can be played by a single player or by more than one player; I have created this as a two-player game because this is my first time creating a game, and I want to be able to control my functions.


How to Play:
1.	Access the Game: Open your web browser and navigate to the game's URL or website. Once the game is loaded, you will see the virtual dice for two players on the screen.
2.	Roll the Dice: To roll the dice, click on the "play" button provided.
3.	Observe the Result: After each play round, notice that the sum of each player's two dice is added to the score section. 
4.  After 10 rounds, the winner is announced.
The game is meant to be simple and entertaining, so enjoy rolling the dice.


Features:
1. 	Virtual Dice: The game features a realistic-looking virtual dice with six sides, just like a physical one.
2. 	Random Number Generation: The game uses a random number generator to ensure fair and unbiased results for each roll.
3. 	User-Friendly: The game has an intuitive interface, making it easy to play even for those who are not familiar with playing games.


Technologies Used:
•	HTML: To structure the game's user interface.
•	CSS: To style and design the game elements.
•	JavaScript: To handle the dice rolling, random number generation, 
    players' count, and players’ scores.


How to Contribute:
The game is open-source, and suggestions are welcome! Eventually, I would love to add a “you get to roll again” alert any time a player rolls a six. This would mimick the physical dice rolling game I used to play with my siblings as a kid.
Additionally, I would love to add the effect of an actual rolling die.
