Roll the Dice Game
 
Roll the Dice Game is a simple game where players take turns rolling a virtual dice to get a random number between 1 and 6. 

The game can be played by a single player or by more than one player; I have created this as a two-player game because this is my first-time creating a game, and I want to be able to control my functions and methods.


How to Play
1.	Access the Game: Open your web browser and navigate to the game's URL or website.
2.	Roll the Dice: Once the game is loaded, you will see virtual dice on the screen. To roll the dice, click on it, or you can use a "Roll" button if provided.
3.	Observe the Result: After rolling the dice, the number that appears on the top face of the dice will be the result. The number will be between 1 and 6, as in a traditional six-sided dice.
4.	Enjoy and Have Fun: The game is meant to be simple and entertaining, so enjoy rolling the dice.


Features
1. 	Virtual Dice: The game features a realistic-looking virtual dice with six sides, just like a physical one.
2. 	Random Number Generation: The game uses a random number generator to ensure fair and unbiased results for each roll.
3. 	User-Friendly: The game has an intuitive interface, making it easy to play even for those who are not familiar with games.


Technologies Used
•	HTML: To structure the game's user interface.
•	CSS: To style and design the game elements.
•	JavaScript: To handle the dice rolling, random number generation, and players’ turns.

The game is open-source, and suggestions are welcome! Eventually, I would love to add a “you get to roll again” alert any time they roll a six. If you would like to contribute, you can follow these steps:
